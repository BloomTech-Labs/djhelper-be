#### This backend is deployed at [api.dj-helper.com](https://api.dj-helper.com/)

#### (Frontend deployed at [dj-helper.com](https://dj-helper.com))

## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm i` to install all required dependencies
- `npm server` to start the local server
- `npm test` to start server using testing environment

The server requires a PostgreSQL database to be running and configured in a `.env` file (details below).

### Framework Details

- NodeJS: The entire API is built in JavaScript.
- npm: The Node Package Manager - manages all project components.
- Express: Simple API server package for NodeJS
- Knex: Database interface. Easily adaptable for different database variants.
- PostgreSQL: Open source relational database.

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a `.env` file that includes the following:

```
PORT - optional port number for this app. Defaults to 8000.
USE_HTTPS - set to "true" if using https. Place SSL/TLS certificate under /cert. (Note: Not applicable to the current hosting environment.)

DB_HOSTNAME - e.g. "localhost".
PG_DATABASE_NAME - Name of the database.
PG_PORT - Postgres port number. Defaults to 5432.
PG_USER - Postgres database username.
PG_PASSWORD - Postgres database user's password.
```

TODO:

- Separate variables for development, staging, test, and production.
- Add these fields:
  - JWT\*SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running
  ````py
  import random
  .join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-\_=+)') for i in range(50)])```
  ````
